# AI Detection Configuration - REQUIRED FOR REAL FUNCTIONALITY
# Get your API key from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key_here

# Optional: Use ensemble of multiple models for higher accuracy (default: true)
# When true, queries 4 state-of-the-art models and combines results
AI_DETECT_USE_ENSEMBLE=true

# Optional: Single model to use when ensemble is disabled
# Only used when AI_DETECT_USE_ENSEMBLE=false
HUGGINGFACE_DETECT_MODEL=openai-community/roberta-large-openai-detector

# Optional: Detection threshold (0.0 to 1.0, default: 0.5)
# Lower values = more likely to flag as AI
AI_DETECT_THRESHOLD=0.5

# Optional: Enable debug logging for AI detection
AI_DETECT_DEBUG=false

# NOTE: Without HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY, the AI detection will fall back to heuristics only

# ENSEMBLE MODELS (automatically used when AI_DETECT_USE_ENSEMBLE=true):
# 1. openai-community/roberta-large-openai-detector (35% weight) - Best for GPT-2/3
# 2. Hello-SimpleAI/chatgpt-detector-roberta (25% weight) - Optimized for ChatGPT
# 3. umm-maybe/AI-text-detector (20% weight) - General AI detection
# 4. PirateXX/AI-Content-Detector (20% weight) - Multi-model detector

# SINGLE MODEL OPTIONS (for AI_DETECT_USE_ENSEMBLE=false):
# - openai-community/roberta-base-openai-detector (faster, less accurate)
# - openai-community/roberta-large-openai-detector (slower, more accurate)
# - Hello-SimpleAI/chatgpt-detector-roberta (best for ChatGPT)
# - umm-maybe/AI-text-detector (balanced performance)
