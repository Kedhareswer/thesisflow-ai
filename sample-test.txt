Sample Document for Extraction Testing

This is a test document that contains various types of content to validate the multi-format document extraction system.

Key Features Being Tested:
1. Text extraction and processing
2. Summary generation capabilities
3. Metadata extraction (word count, reading time)
4. Key points identification
5. Entity extraction and analysis

Sample Data:
The system should be able to extract structured information from this document including:
- Document statistics
- Main topics and themes
- Important entities and keywords
- Reading complexity metrics

Technical Details:
- File format: Plain text (.txt)
- Processing method: Simple text extraction
- Expected output: JSON with summary, key points, and metadata
- Integration test: Validates the complete pipeline from file upload to processed results

Conclusion:
This sample document provides a baseline for testing the extraction system's core functionality across different file formats and extraction types.
