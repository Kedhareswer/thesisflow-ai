# Timeout Fix Verification Test

## Changes Made

### 1. Server-side API (`/app/api/topics/report/stream/route.ts`)
- ✅ Increased curation timeout from 30s to 60s
- ✅ Added retry logic with 2 retry attempts for curation
- ✅ Improved progress reporting during retries
- ✅ Balanced timeout budgets across stages

### 2. Client-side (`/app/topics/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Increased overall timeout from 4 to 5 minutes
- ✅ Enhanced error messages with specific guidance
- ✅ Added progress message handling for user feedback

### 3. OpenRouter Service (`/lib/services/openrouter.service.ts`)
- ✅ Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Improved rate limiting handling (HTTP 429)
- ✅ Enhanced network resilience

## Testing Steps

1. **Navigate to Topics page**: Go to `/topics`
2. **Search for a complex topic**: Try "machine learning interpretability methods"
3. **Generate Report**: Click "Generate Report" button
4. **Observe behavior**: 
   - Should show progress messages including retry attempts if needed
   - Should wait up to 60s for curation (instead of 30s)
   - Should provide better error messages if timeouts occur
   - Should handle network issues gracefully with retries

## Expected Improvements

- **Reduced timeout errors**: Especially during peak usage
- **Better user feedback**: Progress messages during retries
- **More resilient**: Handles temporary network/API issues
- **Clearer error messages**: Users get actionable guidance

## Rollback Plan (if needed)

If issues arise, revert these changes:
1. Change `curationBudgetMs` back to `30_000`
2. Remove retry logic in curation stage
3. Revert client timeout to `240000` (4 minutes)
4. Remove retry logic from OpenRouter service

## Monitoring

Watch for:
- Overall success rate of report generation
- User feedback about timeout issues
- Server logs for curation stage performance
- API usage patterns and rate limiting

---
**Status**: Ready for testing ✅
**Impact**: High - Directly addresses user-reported timeout issue
**Risk**: Low - Graceful degradation and proper error handling
