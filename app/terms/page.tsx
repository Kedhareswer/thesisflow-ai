              <p>
                Before filing any legal claim, you agree to contact us at legal@thesisflow-ai.com to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. We will attempt to resolve disputes in good faith.

              <ul>
                <li>One arbitrator under applicable arbitration rules</li>
                <li>Location determined by mutual agreement or arbitration rules</li>
                <li>Each party bears their own costs unless awarded by arbitrator</li>
                <li>Arbitration on an individual basis (no class actions)</li>
