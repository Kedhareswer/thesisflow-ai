## Implementation Notes

### Mounting Strategy
The support widget is exclusively mounted on the home page (`app/page.tsx`) and never appears on other routes. This ensures focused user experience and prevents distraction on task-focused pages.

### Knowledge Base Maintenance
The system uses a modular knowledge base that can be easily expanded:
1. Add new intents to `intents.json`
2. Create response templates in `responses/`
3. Test keyword matching
4. Deploy updates

### Performance Impact
- **Bundle Size**: ~50KB total (engine + templates + UI)
- **LCP Impact**: Zero (lazy loaded)
- **Runtime Performance**: Instant responses (no API calls)
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (localStorage only)

This implementation provides a solid foundation for user support while maintaining the high performance and user experience standards of ThesisFlow-AI.
