## Implementation Notes

### Mounting Strategy
The support widget is exclusively mounted on the home page (`app/page.tsx`) and never appears on other routes. This ensures focused user experience and prevents distraction on task-focused pages.

### Knowledge Base Maintenance
The system uses a modular knowledge base that can be easily expanded:
1. Add new intents to `intents.json`
2. Create response templates in `responses/`
3. Test keyword matching
4. Deploy updates

### Performance Impact
- **LCP Impact**: Zero (lazy loaded)
- **Runtime Performance**: Instant responses (no API calls)
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (localStorage only)

This implementation provides a solid foundation for user support while maintaining the high performance and user experience standards of ThesisFlow-AI.

## v2.2.1 - Analytics v2 Improvements (2025-09-24)

### Summary
- Eliminated ambiguous ‚ÄúOther‚Äù buckets by introducing a canonical feature taxonomy and consistent mapping.
- Ensured zero-cost usage (e.g., Explorer Assistant bypass) is recorded for visibility without affecting billing.
- Added dimensions for API key ownership and provider to improve attribution and auditing.

### Backend
- Added `public.usage_events` table to record usage-only events (including `tokens_charged = 0`).
- Extended analytics API `/api/usage/analytics/v2` to:
  - Canonicalize feature names and return `unknown` for unmapped cases.
  - Merge additive metrics from `usage_events` with the materialized view `usage_daily_mv`.
  - Support dimensions: `service`, `feature`, `provider`, `model`, `api_key_owner`, `api_key_provider`.

### Middleware
- Token middleware logs zero-cost usage events after successful handler execution when no deduction occurs and for Explorer Assistant bypass.

### UI
- Usage Analytics UI now supports new dimensions and continues to normalize OpenRouter-based providers as `NOVA` with model family grouping (GPT, Claude, Llama, Gemini, Mixtral, Qwen, DeepSeek, GLM, Nemotron, Gemma, Mistral, Other).

### Docs
- Updated `docs/database-schema.md`, `docs/design-architecture.md`, `docs/tokens.md`, `docs/pages/explorer/README.md`.
- Added `docs/pages/analytics/README.md` and listed it in `docs/pages/README.md`.
